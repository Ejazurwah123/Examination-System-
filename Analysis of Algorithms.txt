What is the difference between worst-case time complexity and average-case time complexity?
option dabfac4: Worst-case time complexity refers to the maximum amount of time an algorithm takes to run for any input of size n, while average-case time complexity refers to the expected amount of time an algorithm takes to run for a random input of size n.
option: Worst-case time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run for the average input of size n, while average-case time complexity refers to the maximum amount of time an algorithm takes to run for any input of size n.
option: Worst-case time complexity refers to the minimum amount of time an algorithm takes to run for any input of size n, while average-case time complexity refers to the expected amount of time an algorithm takes to run for a random input of size n.
option: None of the above.

What is the difference between a stable and an unstable sorting algorithm?
option: A stable sorting algorithm is one that uses a comparison-based algorithm, while an unstable sorting algorithm uses a non-comparison-based algorithm.
option: A stable sorting algorithm maintains the relative order of equal elements in the input array, while an unstable sorting algorithm does not.
option dabfac4: A stable sorting algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n), while an unstable sorting algorithm has a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2).
option: None of the above.
