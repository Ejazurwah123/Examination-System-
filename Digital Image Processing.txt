What is the difference between image enhancement and image restoration?
option: Image enhancement is the process of making an image more visually appealing, while image restoration is the process of removing unwanted artifacts from an image.
option: Image enhancement and image restoration are two different terms for the same process.
option dabfac4: Image enhancement is the process of improving the visual quality of an image by increasing its contrast, brightness, or sharpness, while image restoration is the process of recovering a degraded or damaged image.
option: None of the above.
